This involved developing packet switching, a crucial technology allowing data to be broken into smaller packets for efficient transmission.  Email emerged as an early application.\n",

            "**Growth and Standardization (1980s):**  ARPANET evolved, and various networks began interconnecting, leading to the nascent internet.  Key developments included the creation of TCP/IP, the standard communication protocol that governs how data travels across the internet, and the development of the Domain Name System (DNS), making it easier to access websites using human-readable names instead of numerical addresses.\n",

            "**The World Wide Web (1990s):** The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet.  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) made it possible to link documents together in a user-friendly way, creating the interactive and interconnected web experience we know today.  The rise of graphical browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator made the web accessible to the general public, triggering a period of explosive growth.\n",
